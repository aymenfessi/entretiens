**Types of Software Testing**

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - *Description:* Evaluates if an application or software component works according to its functional specifications. Focuses on expected behavior in response to user inputs.
   - *Examples:* Use case testing, scenario testing, regression testing.

2. **Non-Functional Testing:**
   - *Description:* Focuses on non-functional aspects of the application, such as performance, security, usability, scalability, etc.
   - *Examples:* Load testing, security testing, usability testing, performance testing.

3. **Unit Testing:**
   - *Description:* Verifies individual code units, usually functions or methods, ensuring they work correctly in isolation.
   - *Examples:* Function testing, class testing, method testing.

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - *Description:* Evaluates how different software units or modules interact with each other, aiming to identify integration errors.
   - *Examples:* Top-down integration testing, bottom-up integration testing, system integration testing.

5. **System Testing:**
   - *Description:* Tests the entire application to ensure it meets overall system specifications and requirements.
   - *Examples:* Validation testing, compliance testing, deployment testing.

6. **Regression Testing:**
   - *Description:* Performed to ensure code changes haven't introduced new errors and existing functionalities continue to work as intended.
   - *Examples:* Automated regression testing, manual regression testing.

7. **Performance Testing:**
   - *Description:* Evaluates application responsiveness, speed, capacity, and stability under various load conditions.
   - *Examples:* Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing.

8. **Security Testing:**
   - *Description:* Assesses the application's resistance to threats and potential attacks, aiming to identify security vulnerabilities.
   - *Examples:* Penetration testing, automated security testing, compliance testing.

9. **User Interface (UI) Testing:**
   - *Description:* Verifies that the application's user interface is user-friendly, compliant with design standards, and functions correctly.
   - *Examples:* Usability testing, accessibility testing, cross-browser compatibility testing.

10. **Usability Testing:**
    - *Description:* Evaluates the overall user experience of the application, ensuring it's intuitive and pleasant to use.
    - *Examples:* Ergonomic evaluations, navigation flow testing, user satisfaction testing.

**Classification of Anomalies in Software Testing**

When managing identified anomalies during software testing, it's helpful to classify them based on different criteria. Here are some commonly used classifications:

1. **Severity:**
   - *Critical Anomaly:* A major error severely affecting the software's core functionality or causing complete application failure.
   - *Major Anomaly:* Significantly impacting software use or performance but not necessarily causing complete failure.
   - *Minor Anomaly:* A minor issue with limited impact on the software, not significantly hindering its use.

2. **Predictability:**
   - *Predictable Anomaly:* An error that could have been anticipated or detected earlier with proper testing or better requirement management.
   - *Unpredictable Anomaly:* An error that couldn't be easily anticipated and emerged during testing.

3. **Impact on Product Quality:**
   - *Blocking Anomaly:* An anomaly blocking deployment or normal software use, requiring immediate fixing.
   - *Quality-Impacting Anomaly:* An anomaly affecting overall software quality but not necessarily blocking its use.
   - *Cosmetic Anomaly:* A minor quality impact usually related to the appearance of the user interface.

4. **Origin:**
   - *Functional Anomaly:* Related to software functionalities, such as errors in business logic.
   - *Technical Anomaly:* Concerns technical issues like programming errors or inadequate performance.

5. **Lifecycle Stage:**
   - *Early Discovery Anomaly:* Identified in the early development or testing phases.
   - *Late Discovery Anomaly:* Identified in advanced project stages, potentially causing delays and additional costs.

6. **Priority:**
   - *High Priority:* Anomalies needing immediate correction due to their impact on software use or quality.
   - *Low Priority:* Anomalies with less critical impact, can be addressed at a later stage.

Classifying anomalies helps prioritize efforts for software improvement and correction based on their impact and importance to the project.
